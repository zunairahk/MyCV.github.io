            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Zunairah Khan. I am a student and am currently doing my Bachelors
                from FAST National University, Karachi. My hobbies include learning new languages, 
                baking, and yoga.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>Why am I different?</h1>
            <p>
                I like learning new things, therefore, I have studied a wide range of subjects such 
                as cryptography, biology, literature, history, arts, etc. Ofcourse, there may be many
                things that I do not know, but I am a fast learner, and am always willing to learn.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>What can I contribute?</h1>
            <p>
                I will use my skills in computer science to help other people. As my FYP, I am currently 
                creating a wedding planning app that will allow the would-be couples to plan each and every 
                detail of the wedding from the deciding and hiring vendors, to choosing a dress, deciding 
                on a venue, etc. The app will save time, effort, and money. I plan to work on similar 
                projects in the future too.
            </p>
